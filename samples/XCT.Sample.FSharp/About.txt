This project was added to ensure Xamarin.CommunityToolkit support for F#

Specifically, in an earilier version of Xamarin.CommunityToolkit, it was reported that F# projects couldn't use the Xamarin.CommunityToolkit NuGet package: https://github.com/xamarin/XamarinCommunityToolkit/commit/e569ee3a2f4cabaffdcfad11edbc2ef495cbe51b

This project ensures that all future releases of Xamarin.CommunityToolkit will continue to be compatible with F#.
