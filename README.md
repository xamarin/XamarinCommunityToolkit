## Principles

 - Principle #1: The toolkit will be kept simple.
 - Principle #2: As soon as a comparable feature is available in the Windows SDK for Windows 10, it will be marked as deprecated.
 - Principle #3: All features will be supported for two Windows SDK for Windows 10 release cycles or until another principle supersedes it.
